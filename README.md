The Runway Model SDK allows you to port new and existing machine learning models to the Runway platform. With a few lines of code, you can modify your Python model to be used and shared by others on [Runway](https://runwayml.com).

## Installing

The SDK supports Python 3.6+. You can install the module using either pip or pip3 like so:

```
pip3 install runway-python
```

Now head over to [the sdk docs](https://sdk.runwayml.com) to learn how to use the Runway Model SDK.

## Docs

Reference and documentation for the Runway Model SDK is hosted at [sdk.runwayml.com](https://sdk.runwayml.com). These docs provide an overview of how to use the SDK to port your own ML models.

The [Runway Model Template repo](https://github.com/runwayml/model-template) also contains a simple example of how to get started porting a model to Runway.

See the *Importing Models into Runway* [tutorial](https://docs.runwayapp.ai/#/importing) for a walk-through illustrating how to port a model to Runway.

## Developing

If you'd like to contribute to the development of the Runway Python SDK, you can clone and modify this repository by following the instructions below.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/runwayml/model-sdk runway-model-sdk
cd runway-model-sdk

## optionally use a virtual environment
# virtualenv -p python3 venv && source venv/bin/activate

# install dependencies
python3 setup.py install

# install the dev dependencies
make dev
```

### Testing

Automated tests for the Runway Model SDK are written using `pytest` and live in the `tests/` directory. We also provide support for code coverage via `pytest-cov`. 

```bash
## Create and activate a python3 virtual environment if you need to.
# virtualenv -p python3 venv && source ./venv/bin/activate

# make sure you have the development dependencies installed
make dev

# run the tests
make test

# by default pytest suppresses stdout and stderr during testing, so run tests
# like this if you'd like to see the output from your print() statements during
# testing
make test-debug

# to generate coverage statistics while running tests, use this command.
# it prints test coverage to the console and also generates a more detailed HTML
# report in htmlcov/.
make coverage
```

If you make a PR against this repo, please be sure to include automated tests to validate that your code works as expected. PRs will be automatically blocked by a [Codecov](https://codecov.io/) bot if their changes reduce the overall test coverage of the Runway Model SDK package.

### Building the Docs

The Model SDK documentation is generated from inline source code using docstrings,  [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/), and a modified Read the Docs HTML theme. The version of Sphinx that we are using (v2.0.1) requires Python 3.

```bash
## Create and activate a python3 virtual environment if you need to.
# virtualenv -p python3 venv && source ./venv/bin/activate

# make sure you have the docs dependencies installed
make dev-docs

# build the docs
make docs
```

Your auto-generated HTML docs should now appear in `docs/build/html`.

### Questions

We have a `#model-sdk` channel in our public [Slack](https://runwayml.com/joinslack) workspace that you can use to ask questions or chat with the Runway team about this Python module. Feel free to open an issue as well!
