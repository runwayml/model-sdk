# Runway Python SDK

## Developing

If you'd like to contribute to the development of the Runway Python SDK, you can clone and modify this repository by following the instructions below. At the time of this writing the SDK is compatible with Python 2.7 and Python 3, however we strongly recommend that you use this SDK with Python 3.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/runwayml/rw_python_sdk

## optionally use a virtual environment
# virtualenv -p python3 venv
# source venv/bin/activate

# install dependencies
python3 setup.py install
```

### Generating Docs

Module documentation is generated from inline source code using docstrings and [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/). You can build the docs inside the `docs/` directory using `make`.

```bash
# TODO: sphinx requires several dependencies, mention those here...
cd docs
make html
```

Your autogenerated HTML docs should now appear in `docs/build/html`.
