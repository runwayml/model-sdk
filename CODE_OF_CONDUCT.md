# Citizen Code of Conduct

## In Short

Our Code of Conduct (CoC) at Runway aims to ensure we create an inclusive and diverse community. We aim to create a harrassment-free community. As a result, we promote:

* Kindness
* Equality
* Respect

This code of conduct applies to both online platforms and in-person experiences.

If you find you are a victim, or witness any form of harrassment, either alert a Runyway Organiser immediately, or please use our [reporting tool to report the incident](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeFaYn-dBkCJ9hRcrCktw1XfqgE8Gf5fu6XnK9FUBIV36iBnQ/viewform).


## In Detail

### 1. Purpose

As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

We invite all those who participate in Runway to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

 * Attempt collaboration before conflict.
 * Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
 * Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
 * Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

### 3. Unacceptable Behavior

### 4. Weapons Policy

No weapons will be allowed at Runway events, community spaces, or in other spaces covered by the scope of this Code of Conduct. Weapons include but are not limited to guns, explosives (including fireworks), and large knives such as those used for hunting or display, as well as any other item used for the purpose of causing injury or harm to others. Anyone seen in possession of one of these items will be asked to leave immediately, and will only be allowed to return without the weapon. Community members are further expected to comply with all state and local laws on this matter.

### 5. Reporting an Incident

If you are at an event and experience any unacceptable please do reach out to Runway staff as soon as possible. We will handle any form of unacceptable behavior as soon as it comes to our attention.

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior and want to raise an incident report, please do use our [reporting tool to report the incident](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeFaYn-dBkCJ9hRcrCktw1XfqgE8Gf5fu6XnK9FUBIV36iBnQ/viewform) as soon as you can. If you choose to raise an incident report, we will ensure we investigate and provide followup within 2 weeks of the report. Your information will remain confidential from submitting the report.

Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.

### 6. Conflict Resolution

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors/employees will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If you have used our reporting tool, to report an incident and breach of our CoC, we will begin an internal investigation of the incident. This may involve follow-up talks to ensure we have as much information as possible to ensure we take appropriate action. We aim to respond within two weeks of submitting an incident report.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).

### 7. Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify Runway with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies.

We reserve the right to reject any grievance and report which we believe to be made in bad faith.

### 8. Scope

We expect all community participants (contributors/sponsors/other) to abide by this Code of Conduct in any community participation - online and in-person.

This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.
